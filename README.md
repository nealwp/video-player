# video-player

A small app that features a video player on a webpage.

I used [iEatWebsites](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0o60y3FtVy3M93JcDFVreA) tutorial series on making a video player as a starting point:

* [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YheuzX6zmpg&t=65s)
* [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuqEv5o0udw)
* [Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nf24no8dKU)

From there I added my own custom modifications:

* Font Awesome icons for play/pause/volume
* Google font (Quicksand)
* Different color scheme 
* Volume slider fill based on thumb position
* Volume slider transition
